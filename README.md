The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.

OBJECTIVE:-
The main objective of the KNN algorithm is to predict the classification of a new sample point based on data points that are separated into several individual classes.
